# Review and merge

## Review

- Read the full diff and the issue's complete comment thread.
- Verify repository claims with searches and focused reads. Exercise the write
  path when the diff cannot demonstrate the behavior.
- Relay evidence exactly and make only conclusions you independently derived.
- Check profile scoping, write transactions, authorization boundaries, identity
  handling, and shared one-question-one-computation models.
- Require tests at the tier that can observe the defect.
- Inspect cross-PR conflicts, stale shared signatures, binary-looking diffs,
  measured-count claims, and unintended generated-data changes.
- Flag owner-visible judgment calls in the COMMENT review.

## Adversarial lane

- Run `adversarial-review-brief.mjs <pr> --check` for every PR.
- High-stakes paths—data integrity, auth boundaries, and safety signals—require
  a separate agent to execute falsifying attacks.
- The merge waits for that report. Fix each refuted claim or record a reasoned
  override in the thread.

## Migrations

- Applied migrations are keyed by name; numbered migrations 001–185 are closed.
- Add `YYYYMMDD-slug.ts`, export `{ name, up }`, append it last, and add its hash
  to `manifest.json`. Never edit a shipped migration.
- Merge order defines migration order. Resolve `versions/index.ts` conflicts by
  keeping both entries and appending the later merge last.
- Recreate development databases containing abandoned, unknown migration names.

## Merge

- Squash merge through MCP only after CI is green on the exact head.
- Serialize merges. After each merge, recheck every open PR's mergeability and
  refresh or reconcile affected branches.
- A later conflicting PR rebases only after the last earlier conflict lands.
- Resume the author for semantic conflict resolution; do not hand-integrate
  feature code.
- Verify linked issues closed, then clean the worktree and local branch.

## Merge queue

- The checked-in merge-queue ruleset is inactive while the repository is under
  a personal account.
- Until organization transfer, keep the manual serialization and exact-head
  checks above.
- After transfer, apply the ruleset and validate the speculative merge commit
  before retiring manual serialization.
