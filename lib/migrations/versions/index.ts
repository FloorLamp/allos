// The ordered, append-only list of schema migrations (issue #119). ORDER IS THE
// CONTRACT: a migration's position (1-based) must equal its `id`, and the runner
// stamps `PRAGMA user_version` with it. To add a schema change, create the next
// `NNN-<slug>.ts`, export a `Migration` from it, append it here, and add its hash
// to lib/migrations/manifest.json (the immutability guard). NEVER edit or reorder
// a shipped entry — append a corrective migration instead.
